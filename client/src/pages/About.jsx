      <h2>About Our Totally Unsecure Comments Website</h2>
      <p>
        You can use this site to add comments and gain kudos. Other users can
        give you kudos by upvoting your comments. Since we haven&apos;t got any
        authentication yet, you can also massively upvote your own comments just
        by clicking repeatedly on the Kudos button! Once you reach a certain
        amount of kudos, you can buy an interdimensional kudos oven to bake
        kudos even faster.
