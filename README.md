week 7 assignment

i've abandoned this assignment, for the same reasons i abandoned the last four. i did get as far as executing the code this time, so i fixed some of the simpler and more obvious bugs, and uploaded it to github. i'll see if it works on vercel and render, i expect it will as they're already set up, but we'll see. so there may be something to mark. i don't think i'll do any more assignments or workshops, as it's so damaging to my learning outcomes and there are only a few weeks left to start catching up. if this means i'll be expelled from the course, then perhaps we can come to some kind of compromise as i'd like to stay until at least the start of week 11 so that i get access to all the course materials before leaving.
